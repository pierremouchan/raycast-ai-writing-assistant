The AI writing Assistant is here to help you with any tasks you want. The extension comes with default commands that you can override and extend:

You have access to the default example file here: `assets/default-ai-commands-example.csv`
You can open it in any CSV tool, add as many commands as you want, and configure the Raycast extension to use this new file.

```tip
Please have a look at how I structured my commands, your selected text will be appended between an opening `***START_MESSAGE***` and a closing `***END_MESSAGE***`. This helps the AI to be more precise and only output the desired result.
```

## Why is it not in the official Raycast store?

Right now the extension is missing some features and minor details that I would like to address before publishing it live; however, if you wish to contribute to the project, feel free to contact me, open issues, or create PRs.
